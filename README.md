# SentimentAnalysis

This is a python based research project which uses naive bayes and SVM machine learning algorithms to determine the sentiment of a tweet as positive or negative. 
Already labelled tweets were considered for this project.
The feature vector are the words occuring with the highest frequency in the training set. We recieved a pretty satifactory accuracy with SVM.
